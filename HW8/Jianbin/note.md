# HW8 – Unit Testing (Jest)

## 1. What is unit testing?
Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of an application are tested in isolation. The goal is to make sure each function or component behaves as expected.

---

## 2. What is Jest?
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It is commonly used to test JavaScript and React applications. Jest provides a test runner, assertion methods, mocking utilities, and code coverage tools.

---

## 3. What is a test case?
A test case is a set of actions or conditions used to verify that a specific piece of code works correctly. A test case usually includes input data, expected output, and assertions.

---

## 4. What is mocking in unit testing?
Mocking is the process of replacing real implementations with fake ones. It allows developers to test code in isolation without depending on external services such as APIs or databases.

---

## 5. Why do we need mock functions?
Mock functions are used to isolate the code being tested, control external dependencies, avoid side effects like network requests, and improve test reliability and speed.

---

## 6. What is code coverage?
Code coverage measures how much of the source code is executed during testing. It helps identify untested code and improve overall test quality.

---

## 7. What is the difference between unit testing and integration testing?
Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation. Integration testing focuses on testing how multiple components or modules work together.

---

## 8. What tools are commonly used for unit testing in React?
Common tools include:
- Jest for running tests and assertions
- React Testing Library for testing React components
- Jest mock functions for mocking APIs and dependencies
