## Part 2: CSS Fundamentals Q&A

### 1. What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and positioning of HTML elements.

---

### 2. What are the three ways to apply CSS?
1. Inline CSS  
2. Internal CSS (`<style>` inside the `<head>`)  
3. External CSS (separate `.css` file)

---

### 3. Difference between class selector and id selector
- Class selector (`.class`) can be reused on multiple elements.
- ID selector (`#id`) must be unique within a page.

---

### 4. What is the CSS box model?
The CSS box model consists of:
- Content
- Padding
- Border
- Margin

---

### 5. Difference between margin and padding
- `margin` controls space outside the element.
- `padding` controls space inside the element.

---

### 6. What is the `display` property?
The `display` property defines how an element is rendered.
Common values include:
- block
- inline
- inline-block
- none
- flex
- grid

---

### 7. Difference between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`
- `display: none` removes the element from the layout.
- `visibility: hidden` hides the element but keeps its space.

---

### 8. What is the `position` property?
The `position` property specifies how an element is positioned.
Common values:
- static
- relative
- absolute
- fixed
- sticky

---

### 9. Difference between `relative` and `absolute`
- `relative` positions the element relative to itself.
- `absolute` positions the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

---

### 10. What is Flexbox?
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system used to arrange elements in rows or columns with easy alignment and spacing.

---

### 11. Common Flexbox properties
- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `flex-wrap`

---

### 12. What is CSS Grid?
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows layout of rows and columns at the same time.

---

### 13. Difference between Flexbox and Grid
- Flexbox is one-dimensional (row or column).
- Grid is two-dimensional (rows and columns).

---

### 14. What is `z-index`?
The `z-index` property controls the vertical stacking order of positioned elements. Elements with higher values appear in front.
